# Catchers: An Open-Source RAG-Based Q&A App

**Catchers** is an open-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) app designed to answer questions based on uploaded documents. Whether youâ€™re handling customer queries, analyzing project data, or simplifying document-based insights, Catchers can help.

## Features

- **Document-Based Q&A**: Upload `.txt` files, and Catchers provides answers derived from your data.  
- **Advanced AI Models**: Combines HuggingFace embeddings and GPT for document understanding and response generation.  
- **Open-Source and Free**: Designed to be accessible and customizable for everyone.  
- **Privacy**: Your uploaded data stays local.  

## Included Example Document

A sample document, `emailExample.txt`, is provided to help you test the app's functionality. It contains mock data to demonstrate how Catchers can handle inquiries and generate responses.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Ensure you have Python and the required packages installed. Run the following command 

2. **Set Environment Variables**:  
   Create a `.env` file to store any required API keys or configurations.

3. **Run the App**:  
   Launch the app locally:  
   ```bash
   python SecureAsk.py
   ```

4. **Test the Example**:  
   Upload `emailExample.txt` through the app interface to see how it processes and answers questions.

## How It Works

1. Upload `.txt` files containing the data you want to query.  
2. Catchers indexes the documents and generates embeddings via Sentence Transformers.  
3. Enter your query to retrieve relevant document sections and generate a tailored response.
